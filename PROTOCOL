Principles that I learned while working on this project:

- Always check your code first: run through the logic, verify syntaxes' accuracy before running the code (save you much time, time is money!)
- Pay attention to the variable name (careful with naming convention and possible wrong pointer)
- Pay attention to which database that you queried vs what are you expecting
- Understand variable type when you use it! Also save you much time and effort.
- Think modular design!
- Echo line by line for debugging: see where the token stops => ERROR!
- Read the documentation properly! Careful with parameters
- If there is no data, print_r () -> is the num of row 0?
- if pressing a submit button, the variable will be gone byebye. solution: store in session variable, or, put it as a variable passed in the url and call it using GET request.
- Use
  ini_set('display_errors', 1);
  error_reporting(E_ALL);
  to display errors.
